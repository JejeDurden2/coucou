## Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:** Purchasing decisions are increasingly driven by AI assistants, but brands have zero visibility into whether ChatGPT or Claude recommends them. They're losing customers without knowing it.
**Why alternatives fall short:** Traditional SEO tools (Semrush, Ahrefs) don't track AI-generated responses. Manual testing is time-consuming and inconsistent. No established tooling exists for GEO in the French market.
**What it costs them:** Lost sales from AI-driven discovery, competitors capturing AI mindshare unchecked, inability to measure or improve AI presence
**Emotional tension:** Anxiety about being left behind as search shifts to AI; frustration at flying blind while competitors may be getting recommended instead

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct:** No well-established French GEO tool — Coucou IA positions as "premier outil français"
**Secondary:** Manual prompt testing in ChatGPT/Claude — tedious, inconsistent, no historical tracking
**Indirect:** Traditional SEO tools (Semrush, Ahrefs, Moz) — don't cover AI-generated responses at all

## Differentiation

**Key differentiators:**

- Multi-LLM coverage (ChatGPT + Claude, including latest models GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5)
- French-first product — UI, support, and market focus
- Automated monitoring with scheduled analyses (not manual one-off queries)
- Sentiment analysis built in
- Competitive intelligence (automatic competitor detection in AI responses)

**How we do it differently:** Automated, scheduled queries across multiple AI models with structured analysis — share of voice, sentiment, rank, citation rate — rather than manual prompt testing
**Why that's better:** Consistent, comparable data over time; covers multiple models simultaneously; actionable recommendations instead of raw responses
**Why customers choose us:** First-to-market in French GEO, ease of use (results in 2 minutes), free tier to test, RGPD compliance

## Objections

| Objection                                        | Response                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "GEO isn't proven yet — is this even important?" | 67% of consumers trust AI recommendations. Google search traffic is down 25% since ChatGPT. 40% conversion increase when cited first. The shift is already happening. |
| "I can just test prompts myself in ChatGPT"      | Manual testing doesn't scale, isn't consistent, and gives no historical trends. You need structured data across multiple models to make real decisions.               |
| "Is my data safe?"                               | RGPD compliant, EU data hosting, encrypted data, no third-party sharing.                                                                                              |

**Anti-persona:** Brands not yet concerned about AI-driven discovery; companies with no digital presence; businesses in categories where AI recommendations are irrelevant

## Switching Dynamics

**Push:** Growing awareness that AI is replacing Google for recommendations; seeing competitors mentioned in ChatGPT; declining organic search traffic
**Pull:** Instant visibility into AI presence; competitive intelligence; actionable recommendations; free to start
**Habit:** Comfortable with existing SEO tools; "Google still works fine for us"; manual testing feels sufficient
**Anxiety:** "Is GEO really a thing?"; "Will this tool deliver real ROI?"; "Is my data safe with a new tool?"
